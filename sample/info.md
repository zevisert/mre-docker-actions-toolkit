The public and private key here are generated explictly for this example. They are not used for anything beyond existing in this zip file to simulate a real-use-case where a license file for a piece of compilation software requires a license that is delivered as a zip file. In a real use caes, that zip file is provided to the docker build via --mount=type=secret, and the compilation software handles unzipping and inspection of the contained license files internally.
